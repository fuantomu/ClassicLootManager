# About
Core Loot Manager is a robust Loot Tracking and awarding tool for guilds.
It's designed to superseed old DKP and EPGP AddOns and it's derivatives and solves it's biggest painpoints by focusing on optimial communication and storage. CLM implements Event Sourcing and MVC programming models to achieve those targets. All data is synchronised automatically.
